						I spent the majority (15 years!) of my professional career in Residential Conveyancing.
						In this fast-paced environment, I was able to gain expertise in many core skills such as problem solving, 
						 coaching & training others, effective time management, managing stakeholders and their expectations, attention to detail and how to 
						thrive in a high-pressure setting. While this was a fantastic place to hone many great skills that can translate well in any career, 
						I was left wanting to do something more aligned with my interests.

						I've now decided to switch to a career i'm more passionate about - web & software development! Over the past few months, 
						I have gained a strong core knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript and also dabbling in a little Node.js & C#. Future learning plans currently include React and RESTful API's. 
						I'm looking forward to starting my professional career in the wonderful world of tech!

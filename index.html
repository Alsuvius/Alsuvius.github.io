						I spent the majority (15 years!) of my career in Residential Conveyancing. 
						In this fast-paced environment, I was able to earn a large amount of experience in matters such as problem solving, 
						effective time management, coaching others, managing stakeholders and their expectations, attention to detail and how to 
						thrive in a high-pressure setting. While this was a fantastic place to hone many great skills needed for a career, 
						I was left wanting to do something more aligned with my interests.

						I've now decided to switch to a career i'm more passionate about - web & software development! Over the past few months, 
						I have gained a strong core knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript and also dabbling Node.js & C#, with plans to move on to React next. 
						I'm looking forward to starting my professional career in the wonderful world of tech!

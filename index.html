						I spent the majority (15 years!) of my career in Residential Conveyancing. 
						In this fast-paced environment, I was able to earn a large amount of experience in matters such as problem solving, 
						effective time management, coaching others, managing stakeholders and their expectations, attention to detail and how to 
						thrive in a high-pressure setting. While this was a fantastic place to hone many great skills needed for a career, 
						I was left wanting to do something more aligned with my interests.
